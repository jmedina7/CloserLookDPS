                                <p>25 October, 2018</p>
                                <p>The proposal has two suggestions: The first is that armed supervisors get access to campus in non-emergency situations. The second is that two armed vehicle officers be stationed on River Campus, and one armed foot patrol officer be stationed at Eastman. Each position would have five shifts, so that would be arming a total of 15 officers. (See the proposal <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.publicsafety.rochester.edu/APOProgram.pdf">here</a>.)</p>
